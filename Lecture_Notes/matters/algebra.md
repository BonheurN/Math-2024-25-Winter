# Notes on Equations of Lines on a Plane## General Forms of Line Equations1. **Point-Slope Form**:     If a line passes through a point $(x_1, y_1)$ and has slope $m$, its equation is:   $$   y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)   $$2. **Slope-Intercept Form**:     The equation of a line with slope $m$ and $y$-intercept $b$ is:   $$   y = mx + b   $$3. **General Form**:     Any line can be written as:   $$   Ax + By + C = 0   $$4. **Two-Point Form**:     If a line passes through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:   $$   \frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y_1} = \frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}   $$5. **Intercept Form**:     If a line intersects the $x$-axis at $(a, 0)$ and the $y$-axis at $(0, b)$:   $$   \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1   $$## Calculating Slope1. **From Two Points**:     The slope $m$ of the line passing through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:   $$   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}   $$2. **Parallel Lines**:     Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope:   $$   m_1 = m_2   $$3. **Perpendicular Lines**:     Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is $-1$:   $$   m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1   $$## Intersection of Two LinesIf two lines are given as:$$y = m_1x + b_1 \quad \text{and} \quad y = m_2x + b_2,$$the intersection point $(x, y)$ is found by solving:$$m_1x + b_1 = m_2x + b_2$$## Angle Between Two LinesThe angle $\theta$ between two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$:$$\tan\theta = \left| \frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1m_2} \right|$$## Distance from a Point to a LineFor a line given in general form $Ax + By + C = 0$ and a point $(x_1, y_1)$, the perpendicular distance is:$$d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$$## Vector Representation of Lines1. **Parallel Vector**:     A line parallel to a vector $\mathbf{v} = [a, b]$ can be written as:   $$   y - y_1 = \frac{b}{a}(x - x_1)   $$2. **Perpendicular Vector**:     A vector perpendicular to $\mathbf{v} = [a, b]$ is:   $$   \mathbf{v}^\perp = [-b, a]   $$## Miscellaneous Formulas1. **Angle Between a Line and the $x$-Axis**:     For a line with slope $m$:   $$   \theta = \arctan(m)   $$2. **Line Passing Through Two Points on Axes**:     If a line intersects the $x$-axis at $(a, 0)$ and the $y$-axis at $(0, b)$:   $$   y = -\frac{b}{a}x + b   $$
